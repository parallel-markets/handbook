## The Parallel Markets Employee Handbook
### Everything you need to know about making a career at Parallel Markets

This Handbook first came into existence in April of 2020, as the Parallel team unanimously agreed to move to a [Remote First](work/index.md) paradigm.  Although the switch came directly as a result of the uncertainty brought about by COVID-19, we believe enshrining a set of values and work practices is an exercise that will make us stronger in the long term.

Here is where we will try to share some of the things worth knowing about Parallel, including our culture, our process and our history.  This Handbook also offers us an opportunity to clarify very important questions about our company. Who are we? What do we stand for? How should we work? Codifying those beliefs into this Handbook makes our values and processes tangible, clear and, most importantly, editable. Making the company our best product is a guiding principle, but we cannot easily improve what we have not articulated. So whatever version of this handbook youâ€™re reading, you can be sure it is not the last.  This Handbook is not only public, it's set up so that [anyone can submit an update](https://github.com/parallel-markets/handbook).  Our goal is to have a real-world description of how we get work done, not just ideal-case prescriptions that do not mirror reality.

If you are reading this shortly after joining Parallel, please take advantage of that glorious, shiny period of permissible ignorance due to being new and ***question things***. It is on you, dear Reader, to ensure our company grows and evolves in ways that improve our relationships, experiences and interactions with the world.    [The source for this handbook is on GitHub](https://github.com/parallel-markets/handbook). If you want to reccomend a change or view the complete changelog, head on over - all suggestions are welcome.
