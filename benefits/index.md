{: .no_toc }

At Parallel, we invest in our employees' well-being and empower them with benefits provided through [JustWorks](https://justworks.com/). As part of your onboarding, you will be required to complete an account setup with JustWorks in order to receive paychecks, enroll in a medical plan and, to the extent you would like, set up contributions to a 401(k), among other benefits. You will be required to designate your desired plan when you join Parallel and again each November when our Aetna policy renews. This section of the Handbook provides an overview of Parallel's benefits program. You should refer to the plan documents themselves, which are controlling, or reach out to the [People Ops Team](mailto:people@parallelmarkets.com) to the extent you have any questions regarding your benefits package.

## Other Health Benefits
### Flexible Spending Account (FSA)
All of Parallel's health plans permit FSAs. An FSA is an employee benefit that allows employees to use pre-tax dollars to pay for out-of-pocket health insurance or dependent care expenses. For more information, please refer to the relevant plan documentation and a [frequently asked questions page available here](https://help.justworks.com/hc/en-us/articles/360004481412-Flexible-Spending-Accounts-FSA-). 

### Health Savings Account (HSA)
Certain of Parallel's health plans permit HSAs. An HSA is a pre-tax savings account for employees with a qualified high deductible health plan. Those enrolled in HSAs can make accumulated tax-free contributions to pay for health insurance costs for themselves and tax dependents— including doctor and hospital visits, co-payments, eyeglasses, prescriptions, certain long-term care insurance premiums and COBRA premiums. They can also contribute to their deductible. Funds within an HSA can rollover from year to year. Unpaid owners are not eligible for HSAs. For more information, please refer to the relevant plan documentation and a [frequently asked questions page available here](https://help.justworks.com/hc/en-us/articles/360004530431-Health-Savings-Account-HSA-).

### Health Advocate
By virtue of Parallel offering Aetna-sponsored health plans, each Parallel employee will automatically be provided with a Health Advocate membership. Health Advocate is the nation’s leading healthcare advocacy and assistance company, serving some of the nation’s largest companies and more than 40 million people. Health Advocate provides unlimited, confidential access to a dedicated consultant (known as a Personal Health Advocate) to help you resolve healthcare and insurance-related issues.

## Ancillary Benefits
### Commuter Benefits
For those working near our NY office, Parallel provides commuter benefits via WageWorks. Parallel employees can use tax-free funds to pay for public transportation - such as train, subway, bus or ferry - as part of their daily commute to work. Funds are moved to the account before taxes are deducted, which reduces the overall tax burden. According to WageWorks Commuter Benefits, employees can save an average of 30 percent off their commute. You will be able to access the WageWorks portal and sign up by clicking on "Benefits" in your JustWorks account.

### Retirement Planning
Parallel employees have the ability to contribute to our Slavic401(k) program. A 401(k) is a type of retirement savings plan sponsored by an employer. It lets employees save and invest a portion of their paychecks either before taxes are taken out (traditional) or after taxes (Roth). You may enroll in the Slavic401(k) program by following the instructions in [this link](https://help.justworks.com/hc/en-us/articles/360004530251-401-k-).

### Home Office Setup
Since you [work remotely]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link work/index.md %}), we want to make sure your home office is comfortable. You can expense up to $1,000 to furnish your home office, every three years.

### Shared Workspace Reimbursement
If you'd like to work from a co-working space, Parallel will reimburse up to $1,000 per calendar year for those costs.  Please note that you'll be responsible for any commitments made to the co-working host, so make sure if you sign a long term agreement that you're willing and able to cover any costs above the reimbursable amount.

### Continuing Education Allowance
If you’re interested in taking classes that you feel improve you professionally or personally, you have a $1,000 annual stipend to do so. This stipend is also prorated in your first year at Parallel, depending on the month you start. Some people take classes directly related to their careers, while some take photography lessons or learn a musical instrument. It’s up to you; the point is to learn something that you feel enriches you as a person and employee.
