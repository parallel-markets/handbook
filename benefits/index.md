# Benefits
At Parallel, we invest in our employees' well-being and empower them with benefits provided through [JustWorks](https://justworks.com/). As part of your onboarding, you will be required to complete an account setup with JustWorks in order to receive paychecks, enroll in a medical plan and, to the extent you would like, set up contributions to a 401(k), among other benefits. This section of the Handbook provides an overview of Parallel's benefits program. You should refer to the plan documents themselves, which are controlling, or reach out to the [People Ops Team](mailto:people@parallelmarkets.com) to the extent you have any questions regarding your benefits package.
