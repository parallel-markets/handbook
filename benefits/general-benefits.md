In addition to our [Health Benefits]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link benefits/health.md %}) and [Pregnancy and Parental Leave]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link benefits/parental-leave.md %}), Parallel also offers the following benefits.

## Commuter Benefits
For those working near our NY office, Parallel provides commuter benefits via WageWorks. Parallel employees can use tax-free funds to pay for public transportation - such as train, subway, bus or ferry - as part of their daily commute to work. Funds are moved to the account before taxes are deducted, which reduces the overall tax burden. According to WageWorks Commuter Benefits, employees can save an average of 30 percent off their commute. You will be able to access the WageWorks portal and sign up by clicking on "Benefits" in your JustWorks account.

## Retirement Planning
Parallel employees have the ability to contribute to our Slavic401(k) program. A 401(k) is a type of retirement savings plan sponsored by an employer. It lets employees save and invest a portion of their paychecks either before taxes are taken out (traditional) or after taxes (Roth). You may enroll in the Slavic401(k) program by following the instructions in [this link](https://help.justworks.com/hc/en-us/articles/360004530251-401-k-).

## Home Office Setup
Since you [work remotely]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link work/index.md %}), we want to make sure your home office is comfortable. You can expense up to $1,000 to furnish your home office, every three years.

## Shared Workspace Reimbursement
If you'd like to work from a co-working space, Parallel will reimburse up to $1,000 per calendar year for those costs.  Please note that you'll be responsible for any commitments made to the co-working host, so make sure if you sign a long term agreement that you're willing and able to cover any costs above the reimbursable amount.

## Continuing Education Allowance
If you’re interested in taking classes that you feel improve you professionally or personally, you have a $1,000 annual stipend to do so. This stipend is also prorated in your first year at Parallel, depending on the month you start. Some people take classes directly related to their careers, while some take photography lessons or learn a musical instrument. It’s up to you; the point is to learn something that you feel enriches you as a person and employee.

## Unlimited Paid Time Off
We trust our employees and our process. Autonomy and self-reliance/management are some of our most important [values]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link values/index.md %}#agency-raised_hands). We want to give you the flexibility to take as much time as you need so long as [your work gets done and gets done well]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link values/index.md %}#focus-on-outcomes-trophy).

## Paid Holidays
We designate ten holidays each calendar year for employees in the United States. When a holiday falls on a Saturday, we usually observe the holiday on the preceding Friday.  If the holiday falls on a Sunday, it is normally observed the following Monday. In addition to the below designated holidays, employees are encouraged to take holidays for any religious or civic occasions they observe that are not covered by the below list. It is important to us that our employees take time off that is [important to them]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link values/index.md %}#agency-raised_hands). Please just be sure to communicate with your team about any non-designated holiday so the group can continue running [smoothly]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link values/index.md %}#efficiency-runner). The **designated holidays** are:

* New Year’s Day
* Martin Luther King, Jr. Day 
* Presidents' Day
