You will be required to designate your desired plan when you join Parallel and again each November when our health insurance policy renews. Details regarding each of these plans follows.

## Other Health Benefits
### Flexible Spending Account (FSA)
All of Parallel's health plans permit FSAs. An FSA is an employee benefit that allows employees to use pre-tax dollars to pay for out-of-pocket health insurance or dependent care expenses. For more information, please refer to the relevant plan documentation and a [frequently asked questions page available here](https://help.justworks.com/hc/en-us/articles/360004481412-Flexible-Spending-Accounts-FSA-). 

### Health Savings Account (HSA)
Certain of Parallel's health plans permit HSAs. An HSA is a pre-tax savings account for employees with a qualified high deductible health plan. Those enrolled in HSAs can make accumulated tax-free contributions to pay for health insurance costs for themselves and tax dependents— including doctor and hospital visits, co-payments, eyeglasses, prescriptions, certain long-term care insurance premiums and COBRA premiums. They can also contribute to their deductible. Funds within an HSA can rollover from year to year. Unpaid owners are not eligible for HSAs. For more information, please refer to the relevant plan documentation and a [frequently asked questions page available here](https://help.justworks.com/hc/en-us/articles/360004530431-Health-Savings-Account-HSA-).
