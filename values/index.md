# What We Value
{: .no_toc }

Having explicit, shared values enables us to focus in a coordinated way.  We can rank choices and move forward with a common framework.  It also makes it easier to identify the kinds of people we want to work with when hiring.

Just like the rest of our work, we continually adjust our values and strive to make them better. This list of values is a living document; they are continuously refined and revised based on lessons learned (and scars earned) in the course of doing business.

## Collaboration :handshake:
We must all be able to work together effectively.  What's more, you should all be helping others, even when it is not immediately related to the goals that you are trying to achieve. Similarly, you can rely on others for help and advice. Anyone should be able to provide feedback on any subject.  The person who's responsible for the work decides how to do it, but they should always take each suggestion seriously and try to respond and explain why it may or may not have been implemented.

### Generosity
Generous people think about others and work towards making the collective better.  We value caring for others and want to help each other succeed.  Keep an eye out for others who may be struggling or stuck. If you see someone who needs help, reach out and assist, or connect them with someone else who can provide expertise or assistance.  Demonstrating we care for people provides an effective framework for challenging directly and delivering feedback.

### Humility
Be willing to accept feedback and suggestions for your work.  Always approach situations as if there is more for you to learn and be willing to take in new information with humility.  Be willing to explain your decisions, especially in cases where you might act against suggestions.  Stand up for your convictions, but keep an open mind for and be respectful of others - this is the best way to promote constructive dialogue and ensure we all are constantly learning and growing.

Don't defend a point to win an argument or double-down on a mistake. You do have to search for the right answer with help from others.  We value your insights and believe a diversity of opinions and backgrounds leads to a stronger company.  If you made a mistake, apologize as soon as possible. Saying sorry is not a sign of weakness but one of strength. The people that do the most work will likely make the most mistakes.

### Integrity
Be a person of your word.  Do your best to set accurate deadlines and complete your work by those deadlines.  If you commit to helping with something, follow through.

### Champion Good Ideas
If you encounter a good idea - whether it's your idea or someone else's - promote it.  It doesn't matter if it's in your area of focus or not.  Stand up for the ideas that you think can make our company, our product, or our processes better.

### Recognize Others :tada:
Recognize the people that helped you publicly.  When someone goes above and beyond expectations, make sure their hard work doesn't go unnoticed.

## Efficiency :runner:
We want to work on the right things, doing exactly what's needed, without duplication.  If there's an opportunity to automate or streamline a costly process - make it better.

### Increase Resilience
We should constantly evaluate the relationship between the importance of a process and its resilience, adding support whenever there's a mismatch.  For instance, if only one person knows how to perform a critical business function, then it's time to teach someone else the process.  No one person should have sole administrator access to a third party service.  Any time an important process relies on a single person remembering to do something, it should be either automated or an email/slack alert should be set up.  Redundancy, [fail safes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fail-safe), and automation should all play a role in critical business functions.

### Self-service and Self-learning
If you encounter a question you can't answer, search for the answer first.  If you can't find it, then ask for help and make sure you [write it down](#write-things-down).

### Write Things Down :notebook:
We document everything - in this handbook, in meeting notes, proposals, retrospectives, etc.  It is far more efficient to read a document at your convenience than to have to ask and explain.  Make sure that what you write is available for others to easily find and contains the context necessary to be useful.

### Be Respectful of Others' Time :alarm_clock:
Consider the time investment you are asking others to make.  For instance, try to avoid meetings, and, if one is necessary, try to make attendance optional for as many people as possible. Any meeting should have an agenda linked from the invite, and you should document the outcome. Instead of having people ask permission, trust their judgment and offer a consultation process if they have questions.

### Communal Hats :tophat:
We value [initiative](#bias-for-action) and a [feeling of ownership](#agency).  If you see something that needs to be done, and you have the ability to help, then do it.  Whether this is cleaning up a communal area, writing up a suggestion for a new user feature, or helping recruit for an open position in a different department - your help is not only ideal it's required.  The phrase "not my job" isn't something that should ever prevent you from taking on a task that needs to be done.  Everyone wears many hats, hats that are communially owned by everyone.

### Prefer Boring Solutions
The simplest (and most boring) solution is most often the best.  The more direct, simple, and easily explained a solution is the better.  Be [generous](#generosity) to those employees who will maintain your solution or project over the long term.

## Focus on Outcomes :trophy:
We deliver on our promises to each other, customers, users, and investors.

### Agency
If you do not like an idea or direction it is your responsiblity to work towards finding an alternative.  We value strong, independent thinkers who will innovate absent oversight. We strive to give our employees room to own and control every aspect of their projects, which ensures autonomy and accountability.  We give people the responsibility to make a decision and hold them accountable for that, instead of imposing rules and approval processes.

### Track and Measure :bar_chart:
You can't improve what you can't measure, and you can't claim success if you can't measure success.  On a personal level, you should agree [in writing](#write-things-down) on measureable goals and then [try to meet those goals](#integrity).  Your team, your department, and the company as a whole should do the same.

If something can break, and breaking is bad, track it.  If there's an important process the company relies on, make sure you can tell when it's broken.

### Bias for Action
Decisions should be thoughtful, but delivering fast results requires the fearless acceptance of occasionally making mistakes.  Our bias for action also allows us to course correct quickly when mistakes are made.  We don't take the easy path of general complaints without including and supporting the groups that can effect change.
