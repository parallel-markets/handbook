# Parallel Markets Handbook

This is the repo to generate [about.parallelmarkets.com/handbook](https://about.parallelmarkets.com/handbook).

## Building Locally

This site uses [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to build, and assumes you have ruby, rubygems, and bundler installed. To serve locally, just run:

```shell
$> make
```

### Upgrading just-the-docs theme

When upgrading the jekyll theme, make sure to upgrade it both in `Gemfile` and `\_config.yml` (`remote_theme`).
