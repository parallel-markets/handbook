## Personal Relationships at Work
Managers and employees with supervisory responsibility may not have a romantic, dating or sexual relationship with any employee to whom they assign work or for whom they evaluate or influence employment or compensation decisions, without promptly advising the [People Ops Team](mailto:people@parallelmarkets.com) of their relationship, so that appropriate assurances/arrangements can be made to assure any potential conflict of interest and/or adverse effect on the workplace is minimized. This may include a voluntary change in the reporting relationship if reasonably practicable. In addition, the Company reserves the right to alter the reporting relationship of the parties involved, which may involve reassignment of either or both parties.
