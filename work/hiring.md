# How We Hire
Our goal is not only to find the right fit for our teams, but to ensure that we treat every candidate with enough generosity and respect that they want to work with us.  Even if they may not be the right hire for the moment, we want them to remain interested and apply in the future for any additional role that might be a good fit.  We want to build positive relationships for the long term, understanding that every candidate is a potential fit in the long term.

## What We Look For
We look for people who place a high degree of value on autonomy, flexibility, empathy, gumption, and curiosity.  We look for candidates who [share our values](../values/index.md).

## Our Process
Generally speaking, each team will go through their own initial process for vetting applicants.  Once candidates get through interviews with the hiring team, the last step is a series of separate interviews with each of the founders.  Prior to an offer, all candidates are required to provide 3 professional references.
