# How We Connect
Since we don't have the same opportunity for serendipitous encounters with co-workers, our interactions must be more intentional.  We should all make an effort to get to know each other on a personal level; these policies help accomplish that goal.

## Annual Meatspace Meeting
Once a year, we gather for our annual meatspace meeting.  Everyone will be flown :airplane: to a single destination, where we get the chance to spend time together in [:meat_on_bone: meat space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_life).

## Promote Social Connection
There are a number of ways folks can connect outside of work contexts.  For instance, non-work topic slack channels, ad hoc video calls to discuss hobbies, etc are all encouraged.  We also prioritize work events where travel and physical interaction is involved (like meetups, events, conferences, etc.).

## Weekly All-hands
The [Weekly All-hands](./coordination.md#weekly-all-hands) meeting is partially a time for us to get to know each other a little better.
