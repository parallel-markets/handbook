# Management
Managing direct reports in an [all-remote](./index.md) environment comes with some unique challenges.

## Intentional Management
Our asynchronous workflows and distributed nature require intentional management. Managers cannot rely on incidental encounters with reports at the water cooler, and managers and reports must have regularly scheduled check-ins and clear paths for communication.

## One-on-Ones
Managers should have regularly scheduled meetings with each direct report.  The meetings should be set at a frequency that both find most useful (and at least monthly at a minimum).  These meetings are times for open feedback - in both directions - as well as anything that is on the manager's or direct report's mind.

Skip one-on-ones, or meetings between a manager and a direct report's direct report (you and your boss' boss) are also highly encouraged as they may facilitate more open lines of communication.

## Quarterly Feedback
Every quarter, each employee will be reviewed based on the extent to which they embody the [company values](../values/index.md).  Employees will also write a review of their boss, to be shared ***only*** with their boss' boss.  If you manage direct reports, then part of your review will include your direct reports' feedback.

## Results Not Hours
Managers should be [focused on outcomes](../values/index.md#focus-on-outcomes-trophy), not hours worked.  Employees should be evaluated based on what they accomplish overall, not on how long it took to do it.

## Recognition
When your direct report, manager, or peer does something great, [make sure they get recognition](../values/index.md#recognize-others-clap).  People ***must*** know their work is valued; in a remote first environment, it can be harder to make sure people know this.  Extra, explicit effort to recognize achievement is warranted.
