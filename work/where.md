# Where We Work

## Office :office:
We have an office in Chelsea in New York :statue_of_liberty:.  Anyone is welcome to visit NY and work from the office at any time.

## Home :house:
Anyone can work from home (or anywhere else they'd like), and the company will cover up to $1,000 every three years outfitting your home office.

## Coffee Shops :coffee: and Co-Working Spaces
You can work from wherever you're most productive.  Just make sure you're following [all the security guidelines]({% link security/index.md %}), especially when working from a public place.
