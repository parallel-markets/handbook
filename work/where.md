# Where We Work

## Office :office:
We have an office in Chelsea in New York :statue_of_liberty:.  Anyone is welcome to visit NY and work from the office at any time.

## Home :house:
Anyone can work from home (or anywhere else they'd like).  The company will [reimburse up to $1,000]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link benefits/general-benefits.md %}#home-office-setup) to cover the costs of outfitting your home office.

## Coffee Shops :coffee: and Co-Working Spaces
You can work from wherever you're most productive.  Just make sure you're following [all the security guidelines]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link security/index.md %}), especially when working from a public place.
